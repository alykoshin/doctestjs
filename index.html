<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> Doctest/JS is a port of a widely used testing module <a
href="http://python.org/doc/current/lib/module-doctest.html"><code>doctest</code></a>
from the Python world.  The original doctest is by Tim Peters.
</p>

<p> Doctest was originally written to test documentation, but its also
an embodiment of a more general pattern of example-oriented testing.
Tests are made up of code and the code's output, almost as though each
statement is an implicit <code>assertEqual</code>.  In fact there
isn't really a need for <code>assert*</code> helpers because it is
implicit in all your tests. </p>

<div> An example is in order.  These examples are all self-complete,
but typically you would include the <code>.js</code> file you were
testing, and wouldn't define (many) functions inline in the code.  But
don't be shy!  It will frequently make your tests more compact and
thorough to define helper functions.</div>

<div class="test">Here's an example, where we will define and test a
<code>factorial</code> function.  Note I've written the test to get a
failure:

<pre class="doctest">
$ function factorial(n) {
>     if (typeof n != 'number') {
>         throw('Not a number: '+n);
>     }
>     if (n == 0) {
>         return 1;
>     } else {
>         return n * factorial(n-1);
>     }
> }
$ factorial(3)
6
$ factorial(4)
20
$ factorial('foo')
bar
</pre>
</div>

<div>There's not much in the HTML that you don't see right there.  If
you did <i>view source</i> you'd see something like this:

<pre>
&lt;div class="test"&gt;Description...
&lt;pre class="doctest"&gt;
$ code
&gt; ... continuation line
expected output
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

Note that you don't have to quote <code>></code> as
<code>&amp;gt;</code> -- it's a little-known HTML fact that only
<code>&lt;</code> really needs to be quoted.</div>

<div>Try hitting the <button type="button">test</button> button and
see what happens.  You might notice it reloads the page.  This is
because everytime you run a test you've probably changed code to
<i>fix</i> that test (or changed code to stop it from failing), and
the reload gets you that fresh new code.</div>

<div>The format is like an interactive interpreter.  There isn't any
one interpreter for Javascript, so the prompts have been modelled on
shell prompts, <code>$</code> starts a statement and <code>></code>
continues the statement.  Statements can be as long as you would like,
and can even have multiple parts (separated with <code>;</code>), they
are simply chunks that are run all at once.</div>

<div>The <i>output</i> is the return value of the statement.  In our
example <code>factorial(3)</code> returns 6.  Output can also include
anything that is explicitly written (using
<code>writeln(value)</code>), and if there's an error then the error
is also written out (as you can see with
<code>factorial('foo')</code>, which is an error).</div>

<div><b>Output:</b> <i>every</i> Javascript expression or statement
has a return value, and some of those values are quite tedious (like a
function definition).  So if you don't include any expected output for
an example, then the return value is simply ignored.</div>

<div><b>Errors:</b> errors are worth testing for, so an error isn't
necessarily a test failure.  An error just results in the text
<code>Error: &lt;error message&gt;</code> being printed out, which you
can match for if you like.</div>

<div><b>repr:</b> the <i>repr</i> of the result of a function is
printed out.  This is an idea borrowed from Python: each object has a
<i>programmer's representation</i>.  This is a helpful representation
of the object, beyond simply what <code>obj.toString()</code> might
return.  Arrays are displayed like <code>[obj1, obj2, ...]</code> for
instance.  Generic objects are displayed as <code>{attr:
value}</code>.  Objects can customize their output by defining a
<code>repr()</code> method.</div>

<div><b><code>...</code> (ellipsis):</b> sometimes there are portions
of the output that are interesting, and portions that are boring.  Or
parts might be volatile -- different on every test run.  You can
ignore a portion of the test by using <code>...</code> in the output.
All the matching is strictly textual.  Note even errors can be matched
this way (maybe unintentionally).</div>

<div><b>Writing:</b> there are two functions to write to the test
output, <code>write()</code> and <code>writeln()</code> (like
<code>write()</code> but adds a newline).  You can use these inside
callbacks or loops to show bits of progress.
(<code>console.log</code> may also still work, but isn't matched
against.)</div>

<div><b>Comments:</b> you can include comments anywhere, if you just
want a comment in your test, do:
  <pre>$ // look ma, nothing's executed!</pre>
</div>

<h3>Exceptions and Logging</h3>

<div class="test"> It's encouraged that you test exception cases in
your code.  You do this like:

<pre class="doctest">
$ function countTag(parent, tag) {
>     return parent.getElementsByTagName(tag).length;
> }
...
$ countTag(document.getElementById('dt-exception'), 'pre');
0
$ countTag({}, 'pre');
Error: parent.getElementsByTagName is not a function
</pre>

</div>

<div> Unfortunately this hides the traceback.  Doctest will try to
print the traceback to the logs; it's not as good a traceback, but it
might be helpful anyway.  If you install <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843">Firebug</a>
or use Chrome's developer console, the traceback will be in the
console.</div>

<h3>Test Page Structure</h3>

<p>While there are ways to test specific things using doctest, writing
the HTML to hook up the runner gets tedious quickly.  The easiest way
to write a test is to look at <a
href="autotemplate.html"><code>autotemplate.html</code></a> and copy
it for your use.</p>

<div>Each test should be in an element <code>&lt;div
class="test"&gt;</code>.  You can give the tests ids, or doctest will
just number them for you if not.  You can include a description of the
test to introduce and explain the test, then use <code>&lt;pre
class="doctest"&gt;</code> to actually write your test in.</div>

<div>The rest of the page is yours to do with as you want.
Specifically you can include other HTML, manipulate it, see the
result, etc.  Testing DOM operations is simple enough as a
result.</div>

<h3>Asynchronous Calls and delays</h3>

<p> Not everything can be tested with call-result, specifically things
that require callbacks and asynchronous activity.  Some DOM updates
require asynchronous activity, as one example -- even if it's just a
moment that you have to release control from Javascript, you still
must release control from Javascript before the DOM will full reflect
updates.  XMLHttpRequests are another obvious example. </p>

<p> To let the test wait a while during an example, call the
<code>wait()</code> function.  This function can be called with a
millisecond timeout value, like <code>wait(1000)</code>, and
<code>wait()</code> alone means a 0-second wait (which releases
control momentarily).  You can also wait for a condition, like
<code>wait(function () {return req.state == 1;});</code>. </p>

<div class="test">An example (with some DOM stuff to update):

<div style="border: #000 solid 1px">
  <span id="some-output">Output will go here</span>
</div>

<pre class="doctest">
$ function updateDom() {
>   var el = document.getElementById('some-output');
>   el.innerHTML = 'Test Output';
> }
...
$ updateDom();
$ wait();
$ document.getElementById('some-output').innerHTML;
"Test Output"
</pre>

And another example of a callback:

<pre class="doctest">
$ finished = false;
...
$ function doSomethingSlowly(callback) {
>   setTimeout(function () {finished = true; callback();}, 1);
> }
...
$ doSomethingSlowly(function () {
>   writeln('Something was done');
> });
> wait(function () {return finished});
Something was done
</pre>

</div>

<p>When using <code>wait(callback)</code> there will still be a
timeout.  All timeouts are in milliseconds; the default timeout is
2000 (2 seconds).  If that much time passes the wait will be
considered a failure.  You can pass a second argument with a timeout,
or set <code>doctest.defaultTimeout</code> to change the value of that
timeout.</p>

<h3>Spy/Mock</h3>

<p>Also included is a simple mock object called <code>Spy</code>.
This object can be called, and you can check if it is called and how.</p>

<div class="test">You use it like:

<pre class="doctest">
$ function funcWithCallback(callback) {
>   setTimeout(function () {callback('foo')}, 100);
> }
$ mySpy = Spy('mySpy');
$ funcWithCallback(mySpy);
$ mySpy.wait();
mySpy("foo")
</pre>

</div>

<p>The args are kept in <code>mySpy.args</code>, the <code>this</code>
object in <code>mySpy.self</code>.</p>

<div><code>Spy</code> takes an options object as the second argument:

<dl>
  <dt><code>writes</code> (bool)</dt>
  <dd>If true (which is is by default), then everytime the function is
  called it will write the function call (like
  <code>mySpy.formatCall()</code> does explicitly in the
  example).</dd>

  <dt><code>returns</code></dt>
  <dd>This is the value that is returned when the function is called.
  Defaults to <code>null</code>.</dd>

  <dt><code>throwError</code></dt>
  <dd>This is an error that is thrown when the function is called.</dd>

  <dt><code>applies</code></dt>
  <dd>This is a function that will be called.  Setting this basically
  makes the function wrap this other function.  If the second argument
  is a function (not an object of options) then it is assumed to be a
  value for <code>applies</code>.</dd>

  <dt><code>wait</code></dt>
  <dd>If true, then after creating it will immediately call
  <code>this.wait();</code>.  You can use this for shortcuts.</dd>

</dl>

You may set global defaults for these options with
<code>doctest.defaultSpyOptions</code>, for instance to never write
calls (<code>{writes: false}</code>).</div>

<p>When using <code>writes</code> (as by default) then when you call
<code>spy.wait()</code> the function call will be printed out
immediately after the wait.</p>

<div>If you wish to be brief about it, you can do:

<pre>
$ funcWithCallback(Spy('test')); Spy('test').wait();
$ // or:
$ funcWithCallback(Spy('test', {wait: true}));
</pre>

</div>

<div>Spies also have some attributes and methods of interest:

  <dl>
    <dt><code>.name</code></dt>
    <dd>The name you gave the spy</dd>

    <dt><code>.called</code></dt>
    <dd>Whether this spy has been called yet</dd>

    <dt><code>.args</code></dt>
    <dd>The list of arguments it was called with (null if not yet
    called)</dd>

    <dt><code>.self</code></dt>
    <dd>The value of <code>this</code> when called (if it was
    used as a method)</dd>

    <dt><code>.argList</code>, <code>.selfList</code></dt>
    <dd>These are like <code>.args</code> and <code>.self</code>, but
    are appended to for each call, giving a history of all the
    calls.</dd>

    <dt><code>.func</code></dt>
    <dd>This is a function with no attributes.  You can use this if
    you want to pass in a mock object that doesn't have all these
    extra attributes and methods attached to it.</dd>

    <dt><code>.formatCall()</code></dt>
    <dd>This returns a string that represents how this function was
    last called; it's what gets printed (if you have
    <code>writes</code> on)</dd>

    <dt><code>.method(name, options)</code></dt>
    <dd>This adds a method to the object.  This is another spy object,
    assigned to an attribute of the parent spy object and with an
    appropriate name.  So <code>Spy('foo').method('bar')</code> will
    give you a spy that is named <code>foo.bar</code>, and is
    available as <code>Spy('foo.bar')</code>.</dd>

    <dt><code>.methods(properties)</code></dt>
    <dd>This takes a bunch of methods, with options for values (or
    <code>null</code> if you don't care about options)</dd>

    <dt><code>.wait(optional timeout)</code></dt>
    <dd>This waits for the spy to be called.</dd>

  </dl>
</div>

<h3>To Do</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Detail should be displayed (but not matched for) when there is
  an exception</li>

  <li>Automatic creation of an output area for the report, if one
  doesn't exist already.</li>

  <li>Easier setup of per-test buttons, etc.  Maybe automatic
  setup.</li>

  <li>Implement CommonJS loading/module. </li>

  <li>Maybe use <code>>>></code> for the prompt, similar to the
  console.  Or make it more pluggable?  Allow actual HTML to break up
  the input and output? (Would anyone ever want that?) </li>

  <li>A clear, documented way to plug in different output comparison
  tools.  Pure string literal comparison is just one not-so-great
  way.  Also clarify how <code>repr()</code> works and can be
  extended. </li>

  <li>The parser doesn't check for many errors, e.g., you can
  interleave "output" with expressions, depending on whether you use
  the <code>></code> prompt.</li>

</ol>
